#Insurance Prediction System
Overview
This project is a machine learning-based insurance prediction system designed to predict insurance charges based on various features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can assist in estimating insurance costs for individuals.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model contains the following features:

Age: The age of the individual.
Sex: Gender of the individual.
BMI: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
Children: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
Smoker: Smoking status (yes/no).
Region: Geographic region of the individual.
Charges: Insurance charges associated with the individual.
Dependencies
List any external libraries or frameworks required to run the code.
For example: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.
Usage
Data Preprocessing:
Describe how to preprocess the dataset (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
Model Training:
Provide instructions on how to train the predictive model using the prepared dataset.
Prediction:
Explain how to use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
Results
Include any relevant performance metrics or insights gained from the model. If applicable, showcase visualizations that help understand the predictions.
